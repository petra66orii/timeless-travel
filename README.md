## Existing Features

### User Authentication

One of the basic features this website has is user authentication. In order for the user to make the most out of the website's functionalitites, they must create an account.

#### Sign Up Page

The sign up form was thoroughly tested and validated. User needs to input their first and last names, respectively, alongside with their email address, username and a strong password. After the form is submitted, the user is successfully registered.

#### Sign In Page

For a returning user, there is a sign in page. In the eventuality they forget their password, they can easily click on the *"Forgot Password?"* link to get their password reset.

Users can reset their password by inputting their email address. Shortly after they'll receive an email from the website with a link, prompting them to a new tab to reset their password.
